# Computing Paradigms Fall 2k17
A repository for my projects from Computing Paradigms

## Clojure
Two scripts are currently in the folder, both dealing with Gregorian Calendar dates. 
base10bday.clj calculates the nth base 10 birthday.
datesbetween.clj is a days between two dates calculator.

## Elixir
Having just started, there is only a Hello world and an empty file that will hold an integral calculator.

## Ruby
The files and folders labeled homework are all ruby projects.
Homework 2 demonstrates usage of yield statements with various squares.
Homework 3 manipulates the filesystem through commands
Homework 4 is a Dungeons and Dragons character creator. This is an ongoing project that will improve as time goes one.
